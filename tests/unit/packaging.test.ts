/**
 * Guards against runtime-referenced files missing from the packaged app.
 *
 * claude-context.ts writes Claude Code hooks into ~/.claude/settings.json that
 * exec `node <resources>/cli/wmux-hook.js` in installed builds. The script must
 * live OUTSIDE the asar (bare node can't read asar archives), i.e. it must be
 * listed in electron-builder extraResources. It was missing until v0.29.1:
 * every hook silently failed, so the sidebar never received PostToolUse/Stop
 * events and workspaces stayed pinned on "Running" while Claude idled.
