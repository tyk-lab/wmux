// ─── TRACE mode signal derivation ────────────────────────────────────────────
// Pure functions mapping real wmux signals onto the visual vocabulary of the
// TRACE sidebar mode. No React, no store, no DOM — so the rules that decide
// "is this agent working, stuck, or lying to me" are unit-testable on their own.
//
// Design rule for this whole file: every output must be derivable from a signal
// that already exists. Nothing here invents activity, and nothing animates at a
// constant rate independent of state — a spinner that spins whether or not work
// is happening is a lie, and this sidebar exists to be believed.

/**
 * Tool channels. Bound to `lastTool`, which agent hooks write as a
 * closed vocabulary, so the mapping is exhaustive rather than heuristic.
 *
 * This is the payload of the mode: at a glance you can tell an agent that is
 * *rewriting your code* from one that is only reading it, without reading a
 * single word.
