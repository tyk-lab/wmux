/**
 * pty-teardown.ts — Central PTY reaping for destructive close transitions (issue #65).
 *
 * PTY lifetime is deliberately decoupled from React unmount so terminal tabs stay
 * alive across workspace/tab switches and split-tree restructures (see the note in
 * `useTerminal` and `App.tsx`). The cost of that design was that shell teardown had
 * been bolted onto only two `PaneWrapper` buttons, so every OTHER close route —
 * Ctrl+W, the CLI (`close-surface`/`close-pane`/`close-workspace`), and closing a
 * workspace from the sidebar — dropped the layout node without killing the shell,
 * leaking a wrapper PowerShell (plus anything it spawned) for the life of the app.
 *
 * The fix routes teardown through the store STATE TRANSITIONS (the single chokepoint
 * every close funnels through) instead of the UI. These helpers are those hooks.
 *
 * No-op for non-terminal surfaces (browser/markdown/diff have no PTY) and in
 * non-Electron contexts (unit tests, where `window` is undefined) so the store
 * stays testable in Node.
